        <p> <b>Longitude</b>: 133.7751° E</p>
        <p> Australia's climate is governed mostly by its size and by the hot, sinking air of the subtropical high pressure belt (subtropical ridge or Australian High). </p>
        <p> This moves north-west and north-east with the seasons.</p>
        <p> The largest part of Australia is desert or semi-arid. Only the south-east and south-west corners have a temperate climate and moderately fertile soil. The northern part of the country has a tropical climate, varying between grasslands and desert.</p>

        <p> Ukraine has a mostly temperate climate, with the exception of the southern coast of Crimea which has a subtropical climate.   </p>
        <p> The climate is influenced by moderately warm, humid air coming from the Atlantic Ocean. Average annual temperatures range from 5.5-7 °C (41.9-44.6 °F) in the north, to 11-13 °C (51.8-55.4 °F) in the south.</p>

          <p > &nbsp;  &nbsp; Australia, a huge country of more than 7.5 million square kilometers (3 million square miles), crossed by the Tropic of Capricorn, has largely an arid climate, classified as desert or semi-desert, except in the extreme north, where it is tropical (with a rainy and a dry season), and on the southern coasts, where it is more temperate, oceanic or Mediterranean.</p>

    <h2 class="mid">Cloud Coverage</h2>
    <div class="left">
      <p> Cloud cover (also known as cloudiness, cloudage, or cloud amount) refers to the fraction of the sky obscured by clouds on average when observed from a particular location.
      <p>Okta is the usual unit for measurement of the cloud cover. The cloud cover is correlated to the sunshine duration as the least cloudy locales are the sunniest ones while the cloudiest areas are the least sunny places, as clouds can block sunlight, especially on sunrise and sunset where sunlight is already limited.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="right">
      <p>The global cloud cover averages around 0.68 when analyzing clouds with optical depth larger than 0.1. This value is lower (0.56) when considering clouds with an optical depth larger than 2, and higher when counting subvisible cirrus clouds.</p>
      <p>Particularly over the oceans cloud cover is persistent with an average 72% of cloud cover.</p>
